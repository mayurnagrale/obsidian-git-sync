Sure. Consistent hashing is a hashing algorithm that distributes keys or data items to a group of nodes in a way that minimizes the number of keys that need to be moved when a node is added or removed. This makes it a good choice for load balancing and fault tolerance in distributed systems.

The basic idea of consistent hashing is to create a virtual ring of nodes. Each key is then assigned to a node on the ring based on its hash value. The hash function is chosen so that the keys are distributed evenly around the ring.

When a node is added to the ring, the keys that were previously assigned to the next node on the ring are reassigned to the new node. This ensures that the number of keys that need to be moved is minimized.

Similarly, when a node is removed from the ring, the keys that were previously assigned to that node are reassigned to the next two nodes on the ring. This ensures that the keys are still distributed evenly around the ring.

Consistent hashing has a number of advantages over other hashing algorithms for load balancing and fault tolerance. First, it is very efficient. The keys can be quickly assigned to nodes without having to sort or shuffle them. Second, it is very scalable. New nodes can be added to the ring without having to rebalance the keys. Third, it is fault-tolerant. If a node fails, the keys that were assigned to that node can be quickly reassigned to the remaining nodes.

Consistent hashing is used in a variety of distributed systems, including:

- Content delivery networks (CDNs)
- Distributed hash tables (DHTs)
- Key-value stores
- Load balancers
- Replication systems

Cascading Failure : 
- Some machine might die and the load on the next server/machine will increase.
- To check if machine is alive or not we have different mechanism to check that.
	- Health Check Mechanism
	- Heart Beat Mechanism
- To solve this type of problem we can have multiple hash function for one hash key or one server
