**1. What is Metadata in .NET:** Metadata in .NET is extra information about the types, members, and other elements defined in your code. This information is stored alongside your code in the compiled assemblies. It includes details such as:

- Type names and their structures (e.g., classes, interfaces, enums)
- Method signatures and parameters
- Field and property names and their types
- Attributes applied to code elements
- Version information
- Security permissions
- Assembly references
