**Extension of cap theorem** :
PaceLC theorem says in distributed system ->
- **P** : Partition can always happen
- **AC** : Choose between Availability and Consistency
- **E** : Even Otherwise -> **L** or **C** Latency or Consistency Means in reality only ac trade off is not happening also there is trade of between Low Latency and High Consistency

Consistency : to get the updated data for every request we need to copy the data from one machine to every other machine so that all machine in a distributed system should return equal and updated response for a request. and for doing that we are introducing latency in the system.

Ex. In systems like IRCTC latency is always higher 

Latency : Time taken to process the request and return a response
