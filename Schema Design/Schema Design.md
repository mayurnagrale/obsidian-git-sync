1. For all the classes in your class diagram create tables.
2. For the primitive types attributes in those classes we will represent them as columns in the corresponding tables.
3. For non primitive attributes -> relationship/associations
	1. Find cardinality of the relation (1:M,M:1,M:M)
	2. Depending on the cardinality represent it in the table
	3. For Enums and Inheritance relationship represent the attributes accordingly
