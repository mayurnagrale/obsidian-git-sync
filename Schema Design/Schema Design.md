1. For all the classes in your class diagram create tables.
2. For the primitive types attributes in those classes we will represent them as columns in the corresponding tables.
3. For non primitive attributes -> relationship/associations
	1. Find cardinality of the relation (1:M,M:1,M:M)
	2. Depending on the cardinality represent it in the table
	3. For Enums and Inheritance relationship represent the attributes accordingly
	4. To avoid having many null values in single column we can create sparse table for mapping  table

	This will be the initial stage for creating database later on you will need to adjust and expand the schema based on additional requirements and complexities, there are other things also that need to be considered ex.
