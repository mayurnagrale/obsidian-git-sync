1. q1.  Is expanses should be paid by single person or multiple person ?
    - for ex if 4(A,B,C,D) person went for dinner and bill is generated of 1000 rs and now only single character should pay the bill and settled later or multiple character should pay and then settled later
     - Bill will contain title, date, total amount and Paid by 
     - Paid by A-5k and B-5k
2. Is the expanse should be divided equally at the time of settlement ?
	- some group may agree to split it equally and some may not 
	- we can add option for that or we can make rule like not drinkers will pay half
	- Shared by :  
		- 1.when split equally A-2.5k B-2.5k C-2.5k D-2.5k
		- 2.not split equally A-1k B-1k C-4k D-4k or it can be any combination based on the rule 

3. One group can have multiple members sa ABCD but not all the members will be included in the expenses.
  - Do we need a group for every expense or we can just have one group and add the multiple expenses with excluding the members who were the part of that expanses.
  - Lets say having multiple expenses in one group
